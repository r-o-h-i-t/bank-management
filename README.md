# Bank Account Management System
Its a project in C on Bank Account Management System using file handling.

I've provided you with the executable file and some necessary files.
Manager's password is **2407**

*****It seems the program is creating issue for 64 bit windows users, Sorry I can't provide 64bit version of this program). However a good alternative is mentioned below. Have a look:
  1. Download DOSBox (from my repo. or anywhere from the net)
  2. Mount C drive to your folder in which you have un-zipped my program
    Say program is unzipped in your desktop with a name bank-management-master
    then open dosbox and write: <br>
    mount c [DRIVE-LETTER]:\Users\[USER_ACCOUNT_NAME]\desktop\bank-management-master <br>
    [DRIVE_LETTER] is where your windows is installed eg. C <br>
    [USER_ACCOUNT_NAME] is name of user you are using your windows with. eg. Admin<br>
  3. Now execute bank.exe by writing<br>
    bank.exe<br>
  4.Enjoy...
